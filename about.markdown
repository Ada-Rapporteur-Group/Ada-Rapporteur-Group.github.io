The website for public comments on the Ada Reference Manual is [here](https://arg.adaic.org/community-input). The prior website holding Ada Rapporteur Group minutes, Ada Issues, and recent copies of the Ada Reference Manual is [here](http://www.ada-auth.org/).

This GitHub-hosted website is a beta website, beginning to migrate some of the Ada Rapporteur Group's resources to more streamlined hosting.
