<div class="Annotations"><B>Reason:&nbsp;</B>We need to finalize subcomponents

or function call that is used to directly initialize a part of an object 
based on the object being initialized. This is important to ensure that 
any access discriminants denote objects that live at least as long as 
the object being initialized. However, if the result of the <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-4-3.html#S0106">aggregate</A></SPAN> 
or function call is not built directly in the target object, but instead 
is built in an anonymous object that is then assigned to the target, 
the anonymous object needs to be finalized after the assignment rather 
than persisting until the target object is finalized (but not its coextensions). 
(Note than an implementation is never required to create such an anonymous 
object, and in some cases is required to <I>not</I> have such a separate

The special case for explicitly aliased parameters of functions is needed 
for the same reason, as access discriminants of the returned object may 
designate one of these parameters. In that case, we want to lengthen 
the lifetime of the anonymous objects as long as the possible lifetime 
of the result.</div>

We don't do a similar change for other kinds of calls, because the extended 
lifetime of the parameters adds no value, but could constitute a storage 
leak. For instance, such an anonymous object created by a procedure call 
in the elaboration part of a package body would have to live until the 
end of the program, even though it could not be used after the procedure 
returns (other than via Unchecked_Access).&nbsp;</div>

Note that the lifetime of the master given to anonymous objects in explicitly 
aliased parameters of functions is not necessarily as long as the lifetime 
of the master of the object being initialized (if the function call is 
used to initialize an <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-4-8.html#S0164">allocator</A></SPAN>, 
for instance). In that case, the accessibility check on explicitly aliased 
parameters will necessarily fail if any such anonymous objects exist. 
This is necessary to avoid requiring the objects to live as long as the 
access type or having the implementation complexity of an implicit coextension.

In the case of assignments that are part of initialization, there is 
no need to complete all adjustments if one propagates an exception, as 
the object will immediately be finalized. So long as a subcomponent is 
not going to be finalized, it need not be adjusted, even if it is initialized 
as part of an enclosing composite assignment operation for which some 
adjustments are performed. However, there is no harm in an implementation 
making additional Adjust calls (as long as any additional components 
that are adjusted are also finalized), so we allow the implementation 
flexibility here. On the other hand, for an <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-5-2.html#S0173">assignment_statement</A></SPAN>, 
it is important that all adjustments be performed, even if one fails, 
because all controlled subcomponents are going to be finalized. Other
