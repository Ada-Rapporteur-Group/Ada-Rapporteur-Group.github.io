Welcome to the Github Pages for the Ada Rapporteur Group.

The Ada Rapporteur Group (ARG) handles comments on the Ada standard from the
general public. These comments usually concern possible enhancements to or
errors in the standard. The ARG is tasked with considering the enhancements and
resolving the errors. To do so, the comments are distilled into Ada Issues.
